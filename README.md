# Where's the code?
I'm currently working in v2.0, so the code will be available here when I release it. But, it's an Electron app, you have the code when you download Yout, ok? 

# Note for musicians
who want to publish their Works on a new platform and that will be released in Yout Player 2.0. Currently the 1.0 version has more than 17.535 downloads around the world and the 2.0 version is expected to have a very significant growth based on the new features and improvements that are being implemented and expected.

This platform will be called as **Discover platform**.

It will be a platform to promote artists and their contents directly from the app. Each artist/band will have a unique and organized page to show their album playlists, shows, interviews, links to social networks, website and other informations. Each user can interact directly with the content of your page and add your playlists to their account. One of the advantages is that you can make your content available with translations in the languages available on Yout and that you wish to support. The recommended is to support at least English and Portuguese. This will help you to expand your horizons and reach a larger audience.

You can check out the video about the platform prototype here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTwXQCFMUQ8

The platform is based on donations. For more information, questions and keep up to date on the development, go to the exclusive group in Facebook for partners: [goo.gl/8IhtcU](https://goo.gl/8IhtcU)
